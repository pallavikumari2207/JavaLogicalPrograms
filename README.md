## Problem Statement:
   Solution for solving array which has All numbers occuring twice except one number which occurs once.

### Approach 1:
   - ***USING XOR benifit :-*** The time complexity of this solution is ***`O(n)`*** and it requires ***`O(1)`*** extra space. 
    
### Approach 2:
   - ***Using Hashmap Benifit :-*** Time complexity is ***`O(n)`***.
   - ***Drawback :-*** Space complexity is ***`O(n)`***.
